# Day-1-100-DAYS-OF-PYTHON

I learned about variables, print function, string manipulation, debugging, input function, and string concatenation. I applied this learning by creating a band name generator. This program will ask you for a city that you grew up in and the name of your pet. It will then combine your city and the name of your pet and will generate a band name for you!!!
